A VR workplace safety training simulator with a value proposition.

Developed during vr_HACK 2023 by Aleks Zheleznov, Andrew Souvanlasy, Idan Gomberg, Koby Smith, and Liam Slappendel.

## Purpose

**In one sentence: reduce training time, costs, and improve the training experience.**

Our Workplace Safety Training VR App targets both employers and employees. Typically, workplaces require a substantial amount of time for training, which can often be **dry and boring**. Our solution makes the training process more interactive and memorable.

The target customer for this solution is the City of Barrie, which can benefit from a more **efficient** and **cost-effective** training process. Potential municipal jobs include:

- Waste management
- Outdoors work such as landscaping and arboriculture (tree cultivation)
- Community sports and recreation

Training can be both **lengthy** and **expensive**. Therefore, **reducing lost productivity** while **providing quality education** would be a major advantage for any employer.

All of these jobs share a common requirement of basic safety training, such as WHMIS and other safety standards set by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS).

Given that the City of Barrie has many seasonal jobs and a high employee turnover, they can benefit greatly from this solution for the reasons stated above.

## Why VR?

We are solving this problem using the budget Meta Quest 2 headset and this accompanying VR simulator.

Using VR for training and education in other fields has been proven. These uses include:

- Healthcare - paramedics, veterinary techs, anatomy,
- Schools - virtual learning
- Large ship operating

This solution is cost-effective compared to the status-quo. There is a **one-time upfront cost** of the VR headset, but afterwards, there will be a **return-on-investment** by shortening the ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù training time.
