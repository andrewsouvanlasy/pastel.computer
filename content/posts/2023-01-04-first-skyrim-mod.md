I fell in love with Skyrim when I first played it in 2012. A big part of my enjoyment came from the modding community. Recently, I decided to contribute with a very simple conditional animation mod called "Lifelike Idle Animations DAR Version‚Äù.

Check it out on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81633)!

This mod uses the Dynamic Animation Replacer (DAR) framework to set conditions for an animation to play. Simply put, I assigned a condition that only a female player character can use this idle animation.

I didn't create the animation itself, so I took care to properly credit and follow the open-permissions set by the original creator.

As of May 2023, there have been over **3,000 downloads**. I hope to create more mods in the future and see Skyrim modding continue to grow (it's never going to die lol).
