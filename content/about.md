Hey, I'm Andrew Souvanlasy and I'm a computer science student at Lakehead University and Georgian College. I like to write blog posts based on tech and software, and explain things in an approachable way.

Outside of software, I'm into PC gaming, streetwear, anime, rock music, and urbanism.

Also, can you tell that orange is my favorite color?
