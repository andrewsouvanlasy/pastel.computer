Software developers, are people who use computers to solve problems. These problems can range from the math logic in a calculator to uploading your anime profile picture to a database.

Developers write code in many languages such as Java, Python, or C in order to instruct the computer to do something. They employ creative solutions such as searching up their problem on Google or by taking a break from the computer (seriously, it helps to step away for a moment).

While developers may possess vast knowledge of technologies or languages, the most crucial skill they acquire is **problem-solving**. Memorizing syntax is not as important as recognizing programming patterns, such as similarities across all languages. The ability to learn quickly is also important, as technology is constantly advancing.
