CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) is a software development practice which streamlines the process of building out a project.

## App Factory

🏭 Suppose we have an app factory. The developers in the factory are like the assembly line workers. They work on their individual modules of the app, and when they're done, they integrate their code onto the assembly line.

✅ Once the code is integrated, automated tests are run to ensure that it works and meets the requirements, similar to how automated machines in a factory test the parts before they are used in the final product.

📦 If the tests pass, the code is automatically deployed to production and shipped off to our customers.

## Why This Matters

With a CI/CD setup, teams can get their code out faster and (hopefully) bug-free with the help of automation.

As a young developer still in school, this process seems like a given. Why wouldn't you only make small additions at a time? Why wouldn't you automate parts of the factory? Maybe the industry just likes to come up with new acroynms 🤷.
